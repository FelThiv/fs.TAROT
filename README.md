# fs.TAROT
Extension to my standard max library.
this is a simpleproject in which I "sonify" each major arcana of a tarot card deck (both upside and downside card positions) and use them to make musical ... stuff? 
One abstraction per card + a "player" patch, a project overview patch and a test patch.

this is an exercise and something to practice give myself an ongoing project :)
